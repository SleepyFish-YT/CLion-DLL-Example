# CLion DLL Example

This is a free to use CLion DLL Example.
Use it for litterly anything but give credits.

### Examples how to use it
- You can use that repo to learn making .dll's
- You can learn something about CMake

### Use Visual Studio Toolchain

### Additional Information
- **Toolchain Configuration**: Ensure your toolchain is set to Visual Studio. Without this, many standard library functions will not function as expected.
- **Mappings**:  
  If your project involves games like Minecraft, where mappings are necessary, use [MCP Mapping Viewer](https://mcp.thiakil.com). This project uses the `stable_22` mappings. Make sure to apply the correct mappings for your specific use case to avoid errors.
  *What are mappings?*  
  Mappings translate obfuscated code or names (common in modding or reverse engineering) back into human-readable names. Applying the correct mappings helps you understand and modify the code more easily.
- **Using Windows-Specific Libraries**:  
  If you want to use Windows API functions like `PlaySoundA`, ensure your `CMakeLists.txt` includes the following line:
  ```cmake
  target_link_libraries(Example PRIVATE winmm)

### If You're Not Using the Visual Studio Toolchain
Using GCC/MinGW toolchains on Windows might limit support for certain C++ standard library features. These adjustments ensure compatibility.
- You can not use `std::cout << "Random text \n";` instead use `printf("Random text \n");`
- Using Strings: Avoid using `std::string random;`. Instead, opt for: `char* random;`

### Why Choose CLion Over Visual Studio?
- Although Visual Studio is popular, here are several reasons to consider CLion:
- Better Organization: CLion's project structure and interface are more intuitive, especially if you're familiar with other JetBrains products like IntelliJ IDEA.
- Superior Refactoring: CLion's refactoring tools are reliable and user-friendly, which is essential for maintaining clean code.
- Enhanced Functionality: CLion offers advanced coding tools, better CMake integration, and features like code analysis and navigation.
- Robust Package Management: CLion simplifies dependency management with a powerful package manager.
- Smaller Project Files: CLionâ€™s project files are typically smaller and more manageable than those created by Visual Studio.
- CLion adds your created files to your `CMakeLists.txt` automatically, so you dont have to.
###### Im a JetBrains kid but still clion is better even if i would not be!

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need to have the following installed:

- [CLion 2024.1](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/)
- [Visual Studio 2022 for the Toolchain](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/de/vs/community/)

### On the Visual Studio 2022 Installation u need to choose Following individual installations
#### Workloads:
- Universal Windows Platform development 

#### Individual:
- MSVC v143 - VS 2022 C++ x64/x86 build tools (v14.38-17.8)
- MSVC v143 - VS 2022 C++ x64/x86 build tools (Latest)
- Windows 11 SDK (10.0.22621.0)
- C++ CMake tools for Windows
- IntelliCode

Once you have Clion and the parts above installed, go in Clion u might download some Plugins you know from IntelliJ because they may be on Clion also.
Then go in the settings and add a new "Toolchain" under "Build, Execution, Deployment" click on the "+" then select 
"Visual Studio" and select your installation path. Then right under "Toolchains" is "CMake" and click twice on the "+" until "Debug" and "Release"
shows up. Click on "Release" and make sure the "Toolchain" is selected to "Visual Studio"
